==== time_shifted_service_descriptor

Defined by DVB in <<ETSI-300-468>>.

Because of the presence of an ATSC version of the `time_shifted_service_descriptor`,
the XML name for the DVB version is `<DVB_time_shifted_service_descriptor>`.
For compatibility, `<time_shifted_service_descriptor>` is still accepted.
