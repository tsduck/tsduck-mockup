Note: While the fields have different names in <<ARIB-B10J>>,
the structure of the descriptor is identical for `broadcaster_type` values 0x01 and 0x02.
In the XML, the attributes are unified.
For instance, the attribute `terrestrial_broadcaster_id` is in fact `terrestrial_sound_broadcaster_id`
when `broadcaster_type` is 0x02.
