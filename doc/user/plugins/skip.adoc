This plugin skips leading TS packets of a stream, until a specific condition is met.
After that, all packets are transparently passed.

Options

[.opt]
*-b* _value_ +
*--bytes* _value_

[.optdoc]
Number of leading bytes to skip (rounded up to the next TS packet).

[.opt]
*-m* _value_ +
*--milli-seconds* _value_

[.optdoc]
Skip the specified number of leading milli-seconds.

[.optdoc]
By default, this is wall-clock time (real time). See also option `--pcr-based`.

[.opt]
*-n* _value_ +
*--null-sequence-count* _value_

[.optdoc]
Skip packets until the specified number of sequences of consecutive null packets is encountered.

[.opt]
*-p* _value_ +
*--packets* _value_

[.optdoc]
Number of leading packets to skip.

[.optdoc]
Note: In previous versions of TSDuck, the number of packets to skip was the only criteria
and its value was passed as parameter, not as an option.
For compatibility with previous versions, the parameter is still accepted as packet count.
However, this is a legacy parameter and new commands should use the option `--packets`.

[.opt]
*--pcr-based*

[.optdoc]
With `--seconds` or `--milli-seconds`, use playout time based on PCR values.
By default, the time is based on the wall-clock time (real time).

[.opt]
*--seconds* _value_

[.optdoc]
Skip the specified number of leading seconds.

[.optdoc]
By default, this is wall-clock time (real time). See also option `--pcr-based`.

[.opt]
*-s* +
*--stuffing*

[.optdoc]
Replace excluded leading packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing them.

[.opt]
*-u* _value_ +
*--unit-start-count* _value_

[.optdoc]
Skip packets until the specified number of packets containing a payload unit start indicator is encountered.
