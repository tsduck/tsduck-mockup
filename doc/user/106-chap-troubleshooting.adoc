== Troubleshooting

This chapter provides some troubleshooting guidelines when encountering problems when using TSDuck.

=== Environment variables

The following environment variables affect the behavior of TSDuck.

// PDF backend does not correctly process "autowidth" tables.
.Environment variables
ifndef::backend-pdf[]
[cols="<1m,<1",stripes=none,options="autowidth"]
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-pdf[]
[cols="<30m,<70",stripes=none]
endif::[]
|===
|Variable name |Description

|APPDATA
|On Windows systems, used to locate user-specific TSDuck configuration files
 (see xref:conf-file-loc[xrefstyle=short] and xref:chan-usage[xrefstyle=short]).

|GITHUB_API_TOKEN
|Used instead of `TSDUCK_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` when the latter is not defined.

|HOME
|On {unix}, used to locate user-specific TSDuck configuration files
 (see xref:conf-file-loc[xrefstyle=short] and xref:chan-usage[xrefstyle=short]).

|HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN
|On macOS, used instead of `TSDUCK_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` when none of them is defined.

|http_proxy
|Define a default proxy URL for commands and plugins which access the Internet.
 The syntax is `http://[__username__[:__password__]@]__server__[:__port__]/`

|https_proxy
|Same as `http_proxy`.

|LD_LIBRARY_PATH
|On {unix}, used to locate shareable libraries such as `tsp` plugins or TSDuck extensions.

|PAGER
|Defined to a pager command to output commands such as `tstables`, `tsdump` or `--help` option anywhere.
 The default is `less -QFXS` or `more` when the `less` command is not available.

|Path
|On Windows systems, the system-defined search path of executables is also used to search `tsp` plugins,
 TSDuck extensions and global configuration files.

|PATH
|On {unix}, the system-defined search path of executables is also
 used to search TSDuck extensions and global configuration files.

|TS_CERR_DEBUG_LEVEL
|A debug level to initially set to the standard error device
 (same values as specified with `--debug` command line, see xref:predef-options[xrefstyle=short]).
 This can be used to troubleshoot initialization steps such as loading plugins or extensions.

|TS_CURL_RETRY
|On {unix}, define a retry policy for Web requests (HTTP, HLS, etc.)
 See xref:web-retry[xrefstyle=short] below.

|TS_DEBUG_OPENSSL
|On {unix}, display OpenSSL error messages on standard error.

|TS_NO_CRC32_INSTRUCTIONS
|Do not use CRC32 accelerated instructions even when available on the current CPU.
 Currently, this applies to Arm64 CPU only.

|TS_NO_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION
|Do not use any form of accelerated instructions even when available on the current CPU.

|TS_FORCED_VERSION
|When it contains a string in the form `x.y-z`, it is used as a fake version number for TSDuck.
 This is only useful to test the detection of new versions. Avoid playing with this otherwise.

|TSDUCK_GITHUB_API_TOKEN
|Used with `tsversion` to authenticate to GitHub when checking or downloading the TSDuck latest versions from GitHub.
 This is not required but it enhances the access to the GitHub API.
 See GitHub documentation for details.

|TSDUCK_NO_USER_CONFIG
|When defined to any non-empty value, do not load the TSDuck user's configuration file.
 See xref:chap-chanconfig[xrefstyle=short].

|TSDUCK_NO_VERSION_CHECK
|When defined to any non-empty value, do not check new versions.
 By default, `tsp` checks the availability of a new version at most once a day (unless TSDuck was built without version check).

|TSLIBEXT_IGNORE
|A comma-separated list of extension names to ignore.
 This can be used to prevent loading a specific list of extensions.

|TSLIBEXT_NONE
|When defined to any non-empty value, do not load any extension.

|TSPLUGINS_PATH
|A search path of additional directories containing `tsp` plugins.

|TSPLUGINS_STACK_SIZE
|When defined to an integer value, it specifies the stack size in bytes of all `tsp` plugin threads.
 By default, an "appropriate" stack size is used. This is a debug tool, use with care.

|===

==== Search paths

The directory search paths such as the system-defined `PATH` and the TSDuck-defined `TSPLUGINS_PATH` use a system-specific syntax.
On {unix}, the directory names are separated with colons `:`.
On Windows systems, they are separated with semi-colons `;`.

[#web-retry]
==== Web requests retry policy

On {unix}, TSDuck uses `libcurl` to perform Web requests.
In rare cases, it has been noted that `curl` fails with "connection reset by peer"
right after sending the SSL/TLS client hello message.
Retrying usually succeeds after of a couple of times.
This is typically seen on some specific servers.
The reason for this issue is currently unknown.

All other Web clients, including all browsers and the Windows WinInet library, perform the same request without error.
Only the `curl` command and `libcurl` fail.

As a dirty workaround, the environment variable `TS_CURL_RETRY` can be set to specify a per-site retry policy.
The value must be a comma-separated list of directives:

[.compact-list]
* `RETRY=__value__` : number of retries for following hosts.
* `INTERVAL=__value__` : milliseconds between retries for following hosts.
* `HOST=__name__` : host name, as used in Web URL's.

*Example*

[source,shell]
----
$ export TS_CURL_RETRY="RETRY=5,INTERVAL=100,HOST=foo1.com,RETRY=2,HOST=foo2.com"
----

Web requests on host `foo1.com` are retried 5 times after an initial failure, waiting 100 milliseconds between retries.
Web requests on host `foo2.com` are retried 2 times only and the waiting interval remains 100 milliseconds.

=== Typical issues with TSP

This section lists a few typical issues when using tsp and provides some troubleshooting recipes.

*The screen is garbled with strange characters*

[.optdoc]
This is typically observed when no output plugin is specified.
The default output plugin is `file` and the default output file for this plugin is the standard output.
This is quite useful to pipe transport streams between commands.
However, if the binary transport stream is sent to the console, the screen is garbled.

[.optdoc]
*Solution*: If you don't need the output transport stream, use `-O drop` as output plugin.

[#insert-nothing]
*A plugin which is supposed to insert some data in the stream does not insert anything*

[.optdoc]
The `tsp` command processes a transport stream.
It can modify or delete existing packets but it cannot create new packets.
Inserting packets essentially means replacing null packets (aka. stuffing) from the transport stream with new data.
When there is not enough or no null packets, no data can be inserted.

[.optdoc]
*Solution*: Make sure that enough input stuffing exist.
The more appropriate way to do this depends on the context.
See the xref:tsp-reference[`tsp` reference documentation] in xref:chap-commands[xrefstyle=short],
especially the section named xref:inserting-packets["modifying, inserting and deleting packets"].
