 .SYNOPSIS

  Adjust the compilation performances on Windows with Visual Studio or MSBuild.

  For the compiler, linker, and msbuild executables:
  - Set the compilation priority to "below normal".
  - Disable Windows power throttling.

  About power throttling: On some recent Intel chips such as the Alder Lake
  family, there are two types of CPU cores: P-cores and E-cores. P-cores are
  designed for performance and E-cores for power efficiency. As a rule of
  thumb, "foreground" processes, typically manually run with a window on
  screen, run on P-core while "background" processes run on E-cores.

  When a compilation process is started from Visual Studio, it is considered
  as interactive and runs on P-cores. However, when the compilation is started
  from a script which invokes MSBuild, it is considered as background and the
  compiler runs on E-cores. The net result is that you have a powerful machine
  where all the performance cores do nothing and all compilations are
  struggling on slower efficiency cores.

  The solution: Disable "power throttling" on compiler and linker executables.
  Thus, all these executables won't be candidate for E-cores and will run
  on P-cores.

 .PARAMETER NoPause

  Do not wait for the user to press <enter> at end of execution. By default,
  execute a "pause" instruction at the end of execution, which is useful
  when the script was run from Windows Explorer.
