# TSDuck build scripts and associated configuration files

This directory contains all build scripts, for various purposes, on various
operating systems. Configuration files for binary installers are also included.
The result is an heterogeneous set of files which are described here.

On Unix systems (Linux, macOS), all build tasks are triggered from `make`.

On Windows systems, all build tasks are implemented using PowerShell scripts in
this directory. Visual Studio is required for development and debug only.
Building TSDuck and its binary installers does not use Visual Studio; the
scripts directly call MSBuild (a Microsoft equivalent of make, using project
files in XML format).

## Portable tools (macOS, Linux, Windows)

- `tsbuild.py` : A common code module for all Python scripts here.

- `build-dektec-names.py` : Build the file tsduck.dektec.names from the Dektec
  header DTAPI.h. This is a "names" files for the capabilities of the devices.

- `build-project-files.py` : Build the project files for "Qt Creator" and
  "Visual Studio" (also used by MSBuild) for all TSDuck commands and plugins.
  See more details in the leading comments in the script.

- `build-tsduck-header.py` : Build the `tsduck.h` header file which include
  all public headers of the TSDuck library. This script is automatically invoked
  by the makefile in `libtsduck` and Windows MSBuild project files.

- `cleanup.py` : Complete cleanup of the directory tree, removing all generated
  or temporary files.

- `get-version-from-sources.py` : Extract the TSDuck version number from the
  source files.

## Build scripts on Windows

Note on PowerShell scripts: A Windows PowerShell script file name has a `.ps1`
extension. Default action for double-click on a script file in Windows Explorer
is to edit the script file using notepad. This is not convenient for developers.
It is recommended to modify this so that double-clicking on a `.ps1` file executes
the script. You can enable this the first time you want to run a PowerShell script
from the Windows Explorer: Right-click on the `.ps1` file, click on "Open with",
then "Choose another app", select (simple click, don't double-click)
"Windows PowerShell" and finally click on "Always".

- `msvc` : A subdirectory containing all project files for Visual Studio. All
  project files were manually carfted to be generic for all versions of Visual
  Studio to avoid multiple versions of the same project.
  These files are also valid MSBuild project files. The software may be built
  either using MSBuild (see `build.ps1`) or using the `tsduck.sln` solution file
  in the Visual Studio IDE.

- `tsduck.rc` : The Microsoft resource file which is used to build the various
  TSDuck executables.

- `tsbuild.psm1` : A common code module for all PowerShell scripts here.

- `build.ps1` : This script builds all TSDuck code, executables and DLL's.

- `build-java.ps1` : This script builds the Java bindings for TSDuck. It is
  automatically invoked by the MSBuild project files and there is no need to
  explicitly run it.

- `build-config-files.ps1` : This script builds the .names and .xml configuration
  files for TSDuck. This script calls MSBuild with the corresponding targets. It
  is useful to quickly rebuild the configuration files when a .names or .xml
  file was modified but, since these files are MSBuild targets, they are
  automatically rebuilt by the MSBuild project and there is no need to
  explicitly run this script.

- `install-prerequisites.ps1` : This script downloads and installs all
  pre-requisite packages to build TSDuck on Windows.

- `install-wintools` : This directory contains scripts to install individual
  prerequisites. They are all invoked by `install-prerequisites.ps1`.

- `adjust-compiler-performance.ps1` : Adjust the compilation performances on
  Windows with Visual Studio or MSBuild. Alter priority and power throttling
  options. See comments in the script.

The following scripts are just conveniences to run the corresponding `.py`
scripts from the Windows explorer:

- `build-project-files.ps1`
- `cleanup.ps1`

## Project files for Linux and macOS

- `install-prerequisites.sh` : This script downloads and installs all
  pre-requisite packages to build TSDuck on Linux or macOS.

- `setenv.sh` : This script builds the path of the binary directory and sets the
  PATH (or simply displays the binary directory).

- `qtcreator` : This subdirectory contains all project files for Qt Creator.
  TSDuck does not use Qt. But Qt Creator is a superior C++ IDE which can be
  extremely useful to develop TSDuck or any C++ project. Note that Qt Creator
  is used only to develop and debug TSDuck. Building an official and complete
  version of TSDuck shall be done using make outside Qt Creator.

## Configuration files for installer packages

- `tsduck.spec` : RPM specification file to create TSDuck `.rpm` packages on
  Fedora, RedHat, CentOS, AlmaLinux and other clones.

- `tsduck.control` : Template for Debian control file, used to create `.deb`
  packages for TSDuck on Ubuntu, Debian, Rapsbian and other derivatives.

- `tsduck-dev.control` : Template for Debian control file, used to create
  `.deb` packages for TSDuck development environment.
