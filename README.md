## TSDuck Mockup Project

This dummy project is a mockup of the TSDuck project, without the actual source code.
All build files are identical. This project can be used to test builds and GitHub
Actions CI/CD workflows.

The script `mockup-update.py` is used to rebuild the mockup project from the content
of the real TSDuck project.
